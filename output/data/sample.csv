Hvem er vi: Skødstrup Hus 4 er et lille hus med plads til i alt 11 beboere. Vi er beliggende i naturskønne omgivelser, som vi gerne benytter os af i hverdagen og er kun 5 minutter fra letbanen og bus. Beboerne i Hus 4 har et varierende funktionsniveau, men har alle udviklingshæmning, nogle med psykiatriske overbygninger. Vi er et helhedstilbud og har derfor vores eget interne aktivitetscenter. Vi er et specialiseret, socialpædagogisk bofællesskab med rig mulighed for at fordybe sig i og bruge sin faglighed og med mulighed for at blive udfordret og for personlig læring. Vi arbejder tværfagligt i et team af pædagoger, ergoterapeuter, social- og sundhedsassistenter, pædagogiske assistenter og omsorgsmedhjælpere. Vi yder individuel støtte, pleje og omsorg til alle beboerne. Alle beboere er mobile og skal have hjælp til at varetage egenomsorg samt ADL. Der kan være tidspunkter, hvor der er behov for skærmning, og beboerne kan have en udadreagerende og udfordrende kommunikation. Vores støtte tager udgangspunkt i det gode liv og en anerkendende tilgang, med stort fokus på at skabe struktur og tryghed, så beboerne har en meningsfuld hverdag. Vi bestræber os altid på at skabe så hjemlige forhold som muligt for borgerne. Din faste arbejdstid vil ligge fra 7-15 lørdag og søndag hver anden weekend. Du vil have mulighed for ligeledes at tage vagter i løbet af ugen – både dagvagter, aftenvagter og evt. nattevagter. Særligt kendetegnende for Hus 4: Vi arbejder sammen med beboerne efter de værdier, som huset har lavet i fællesskab; Handicapforståelse: Vi ser det hele menneske og sætter borgernes ressourcer i spil i samarbejdet. Struktur og forudsigelighed: Vi giver borgerne forudsigelighed gennem struktur. Anerkendende tilgang: Vi ser mennesket frem for diagnosen. Selvbestemmelse – medbestemmelse: - Vi giver borgerne selv- og medbestemmelse. Konflikthåndtering: Vi møder borgerne med low arousal. Sprog/ kommunikation Vi taler med borgerne og ikke om borgerne og har det mindset at alle har en stemme og et sprog. Pårørende: Vi samarbejder med de pårørende med borgeren i fokus. Forventninger til kommende kollega: Du har lyst til, og evt. erfaring med, at arbejde indenfor målgruppen. Det er meget vigtigt, at du har evnen til at rumme borgerne, når de har svært ved at rumme sig selv. Du skal have lyst til at arbejde i et døgntilbud. Du er skriftligt velformuleret og kan arbejde selvstændigt med skriftlig dokumentation. Du er teamplayer, men kan samtidigt arbejde selvstændigt. Du arbejder anerkendende og struktureret, men samtidigt også indstillet på hurtige skift og fleksibilitet i forhold til arbejdstider og pædagogisk praksis for at få dagligdagen til at fungere. Du er psykisk robust. Du har en naturlig nysgerrighed og interesse for mennesker, som har begrænset verbalt sprog og kan tænke måder at kommunikere på. Du må meget gerne have en interesse og viden om IT – og de muligheder IT kan give. Personalet i Hus 4: Vi er en personalegruppe med engagement, god energi og hvor der er plads til smil, grin og sjov - også sammen med beboerne. Vi vægter den gode stemning og åbenhed højt. Vi har en positiv og anerkendende tilgang til såvel beboerne som kollegaer og pårørende, og vi arbejder med respekten for den enkelte beboer og deres individuelle behov. I Hus 4 arbejdes der med at omsætte handleplaner til delmål i hverdagen ud fra KRAP. Der arbejdes ud fra Aarhus Kommunes Fælles Faglig Fundament med borgeren i centrum Vi har stort fokus på det fysiske, psykiske og sociale arbejdsmiljø. Vi har personalesammenkomster 2-3 gange om året, der er en fantastisk gavekasse med gode personlige gaver og vi har en rigtig god ”madmor”, der laver lækker mad til os hele ugen. I vores kollegiale samarbejde/pædagogiske miljø bestræber vi os på bl.a. på at arbejde med udgangspunkt i følgende værdier og kendetegn: Anerkendelse af hinanden som kollegaer: Vi accepterer og respekterer hinandens forskelligheder. Sprog/ kommunikation: Vi har fokus på den positive kommunikation med hinanden og borgerne. Løfte i flok + konflikthåndtering: Vi gør alt, hvad vi kan, for at spille hinanden gode.

Even if only two of these three are in your comfort zone, we’d love to hear from you!<br/><br/>You should have (technical skills)<br/><br/><ul> <li> a track record of productive collaboration with product designers for web applications, and the ability to advocate for the needs of designers in the team, </li> <li> proven interest or expertise in the web platform (HTML, CSS, DOM, accessibility, performance, responsive design), </li> <li> a demonstrated interest in UI component libraries, and are motivated to build a successful design system to help Culture Amp succeed, </li> <li> possibly some hands-on visual design experience (typography, animation, interaction design patterns), because the current team is engineer-heavy and could use someone with a strong design background, </li> <li> and optionally some experience managing a design system as a product, with clear success metrics to help drive a prioritised roadmap. </li> <br/></ul>You should be (human skills)<br/><br/><ul> <li> an avid learner, constantly researching best practices, and emerging web platform features and best practices, </li> <li> passionate about sweating the tiny details that make a user experience really sing, </li> <li> a strong communicator, because much of this work involves cross-team collaboration and discussion, with experience giving feedback (especially in code reviews), teaching and pairing, </li> <li> and someone who shares our passion for making a better world of work. </li> <br/></ul>You should love crafting beautifully designed and intuitive user experiences, and believe that creating well-tested, clean code is just as important for the front end as the back end. You should enjoy being surrounded by talented engineers, learning from others, as well as contributing to their development.<br/><br/>Our teams are remote-friendly, and all embrace flexible working arrangements. We use GitHub to collaborate and review each other's code as pull requests. We deliver to production via continuous integration and delivery using Buildkite (or GitHub Actions where Buildkite is not a great fit).<br/><br/><strong>Please keep reading…<br/><br/></strong>Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.<br/><br/><strong>Non average workplaces attract above average people.<br/><br/></strong>We consider ourselves anything but average and strive to make a home for different types of people from around the world to do their best work and have fun doing it. So we have created 4 “not your average” values that we live by, take a read , and if this sounds like the environment for you, please apply!<br/><br/>We are extremely proud of the Culture we have built, but don't just take our word for it, our Glassdoor reviews speak for themselves!<br/><br/>We are committed to not only making a better world of work, but also a better world. So we are proud to be recognised as a certified B-Corp .<br/><br/>We believe that inclusive businesses are better, not just for “company results”, but for the world. We have a strong commitment to Anti-Racism, and endeavour to lead by example. Every step we make as a business towards anti-racism is another step we can support our customers in making a better world (of work). You can see our current commitments to Anti-Racism here .<br/><br/>We ensure you have the tools you need to thrive both in and out of work.<br/><br/><ul> <li> MacBooks for you to do your best work </li> <li> Share Options - it’s important to us that everyone is an owner and can share in our success </li> <li> Excellent parental leave and in work support programme, - for those families to be </li> <li> Flexible working schedule - where we can, let’s make work, work for you </li> <li> Fun and inclusive digital, and (in the future) in-person events </li> <br/></ul>Most importantly.

Dagelijks beantwoorden de medewerkers, experts in hun vakgebied, de vragen die veel bedrijven en particulieren zich stellen over autoreiniging. Grondige industriële reiniging, polijsten of voorbereiden van de wagens. Wie zoeken we ? Een car detailleur M/V/X is een professional die gespecialiseerd is in het zorgvuldig reinigen, herstellen en beschermen van de binnen- en buitenkant van voertuigen. Ze streven ernaar om auto's in optimale staat te brengen, zowel qua uiterlijk als prestaties, door gebruik te maken van geavanceerde technieken en hoogwaardige producten. Het takenpakket van een car detailleur kan variëren, afhankelijk van de specifieke behoeften van de klant en het type voertuig. Over het algemeen omvat het werk van een detailleur echter de volgende aspecten: Reiniging: Een car detailleur begint meestal met een grondige reiniging van zowel de binnen- als de buitenkant van het voertuig. Dit omvat het wassen, polijsten en waxen van de lak, het schoonmaken van de ramen en spiegels, het reinigen van de velgen en banden, en het stofzuigen en schoonmaken van het interieur, inclusief de bekleding, vloermatten en dashboard. Verfcorrectie: Als er krassen, swirls of andere lakdefecten aanwezig zijn, zal de detailleur een proces van verfcorrectie uitvoeren om deze onvolkomenheden te verwijderen. Dit kan het gebruik van polijstmachines en speciale schuurmiddelen omvatten om de lak glad te maken en een diepe glans te herstellen. Interieurrenovatie: Het interieur van een voertuig kan ook de nodige aandacht nodig hebben. Een detailleur kan vlekken en vuil verwijderen uit bekleding en tapijten, leer reinigen en conditioneren, en kunststof en houten oppervlakken behandelen om ze er als nieuw uit te laten zien. Bescherming: Een belangrijk aspect van het werk van een detailleur is het aanbrengen van beschermende coatings en behandelingen om de auto te beschermen tegen toekomstige schade. Dit kan onder meer het aanbrengen van een waxlaag, lakverzegeling, glascoating en interieurbehandelingen omvatten. Deze beschermende maatregelen helpen de lak te beschermen tegen UV-straling, corrosie, vogelpoep en andere elementen, en vereenvoudigen ook het onderhoud van het voertuig. Detailing op maat: Car detailleurs bieden vaak ook gespecialiseerde diensten aan, zoals motorreiniging, het aanbrengen van een beschermende film (ppf) op gevoelige delen van het voertuig, het herstellen van koplampen, het reinigen van de cabrioletkap en andere specifieke verzoeken van de klant. Het werk van een car detailleur vergt geduld, precisie en aandacht voor detail. Ze streven ernaar om voertuigen in een showroomstaat te brengen, waarbij ze gebruik maken van geavanceerde technieken, professionele gereedschappen en hoogwaardige producten om de beste resultaten te bereiken.

「老舗」といわれる企業に成長してきました当社ですが、皆さんがイメージするような堅苦しい雰囲気はありません。20代からでも手を挙げればチャンスを与えられ、任せてもらえる風土が根付いています。 Ｒｅ就活世代を求める理由は、専門性の高い業種のため、「じっくり3年間」かけて育成していきたいから。つまり、業界・職種未経験でもゼロベースが当たり前。皆さん一人ひとりを丁寧に育てていきます！ 選考のポイント 成長できる環境を整えているため、Ｒｅ就活世代に求めるのは、それらを積極的に吸収する「前向きに何事も取り組む姿勢」。研修や勉強会だけでなく、日頃の業務の中でも積極的に知識やノウハウを吸収していける人材を求めています。 そして、長期にかかわるお客様が多いため、信頼関係をじっくり築ける「誠実さ」も必要です。 これらの素養を持った皆さん、経験や知識は関係ありません。ぜひ気軽にご応募ください。 先輩社員の声 先輩社員１ Yさん／営業職／社歴：4年 前職：なし この会社を選んだ決め手はなんですか？ 私はBtoBの企業に絞って就職活動を行っていました。数ある企業の中でも、当社は「溶接」という奥の深い業界でトップの地位を確立していることに魅力を感じ、「ここなら面白い仕事ができるのでは」と入社を決めました。 実際に営業の仕事に就いてみると、専門商社と言えども、「工場の中のものなら何でも売ってOK！」というくらい予想以上に提案できる幅が広く、私自身のやりがいにもつながっています。そして、それが働きやすさにもつながっていますね。 一日のスケジュールを教えてください。 9:00 出勤 メールチェック、提案書や見積作成など、外回りの準備ができたら出発。 10:30～ お客様と打ち合わせ ユーザー様の工場に訪問し、メーカー数社と一緒に提案。 一つの生産ライン設備をそろえるためには、複数の機械メーカーが必要です。 12:30～ お昼休憩 外回りの時は、外出先でお昼を済ませます。 14:00～ 工場訪問 ユーザー様の工場を２～３件回り、納品した製品の現状や今後のニーズなどヒアリング。 16:00～ 帰社 帰社後は、ユーザー様からの質問の回答、書類作成など。 17:30 退社 効率よく仕事を進めて、お疲れ様です！ この会社の働きやすいと感じるポイントを教えてください。 まず環境面から言うと、しっかり休めてリフレッシュできる点ですね。完全週休二日制はもちろん、有休が取得しやすく、友人や家族と過ごす時間も多いですよ。社風としては、拠点によってカラーが違うかもしれませんが、基本的に気さくでフレンドリーな人が多いと思います。私は個人的に先輩と草野球チームに入っていて、休日に汗を流しています。 業務面では、幅広い商材が取り扱えること。決まった一つの商材を販売するのではないので、例えば「補助金を申請して、クレーンを導入しましょう！」といった提案もできます。仕事としての面白みがあって、伸び伸び働けています。 当社には、他にもいろいろな「働きやすいポイント」がありますので、ぜひそれを体感してほしいですね。 先輩社員２ Iさん／営業職／社歴：6年 前職：なし この仕事のやりがいは何だと思いますか？ 当社の営業は、1週間で受注することもあれば、数年がかりの案件になることも。金額も数十円から数億円規模になる場合もあるんですよ。例えば、人手不足で悩むお客様に向けて溶接ロボットを提案し、同業他社もいる中、打ち合わせを重ねて億単位の金額を受注したときは、大きな醍醐味を感じる瞬間ですね。 世の中にはいろいろな業界の営業職があると思いますが、こういったスケールの大きさを体感したいのなら、ぜひ当社のような企業を選んでほしいですね！ 入社してみてから分かった、この会社のいいところはありますか？ 仕事面で良かったと思うことは、自分次第でどんな商材も仕入れることができるということ。 仕入先も多く、お客様に対しても提案しやすいですよ。そうやって小さなものでもこまめに提案し、受注につなげながら信頼関係を築いています。その積み重ねでお客さんが喜んでくれ、さらに大きな受注が決まったときには、私自身も嬉しいですね。 ときには、社運を賭けたような商材を扱うこともあるので、「営業の醍醐味」という部分でも大きな魅力があると思っています。 この会社の働きやすいと感じるポイントを教えてください。 営業は個人プレイのイメージがあるかもしれませんが、チームプレイで協力し合えるところが魅力だと思います。 例えば、入社2年目で初めて億単位の大きな金額を受注したときのこと。まだまだわからないことだらけで、嬉しい反面、プレッシャーが非常に大きかったのですが、そういった壁を乗り越えられたのは、気さくに相談できる上司や先輩たちのおかげです。営業なので目標数字を追いかけていますが、「やるときはやる！」といった切り替えをしっかり行い、メリハリのある職場だと思いますよ。 先輩社員３ Sさん／営業職／社歴：3年 前職：なし 入社理由を教えてください。 私の場合は少し特殊なのですが、実家がマツモト産業と同じ業種の会社ということもあり、同業他社で修業するつもりで入社しました。 最初は3年のつもりだったのですが、気付けばもうすぐ4年目。この業界は、知れば知るほど奥が深く、面白みのある業界。「もっとここで学んでいきたい！」と考えるようになりました。さらに、自分のお客様を持つようになると、少しずつですがお客様との信頼関係も築けるようになり、お客様のためにより良い提案をしたいと考えるようになったんです。 現在当社で活躍している先輩たちも、入社理由は人それぞれですが、みんなやりがいを持って活き活きと働いていることが、当社の特徴の一つだと思いますよ。 入社してみてから分かった、この会社のいいところはありますか？ 私は直販営業という、メーカーさんに直接営業する部署に所属しています。そのメーカーさんも本当に多種多様。私たちの生活に身近なものも多く、訪問するたびに、子どもの頃のように好奇心をそそられています。例えば、その一つが消火器メーカーさん。消火器は、誰もが一度は見たことがあるもので、いざというときに必要不可な製品。ですが、その製造方法をなんて、なかなか目にすることはありません。それらを間近でみることができ、モノづくりの面白みを体感できるのは、当社ならではの楽しみだと思いますよ！ この会社の働きやすいと感じるポイントを教えてください。 社風として、気さくで話しやすい人が多いところが働きやすいポイントですね。休日の多さや福利厚生面も充実していますが、こういった社風が自分に合っているという点は、働きやすさを左右するところだと思っています。 また、サポート部署が多いことも働きやすいと感じるところですね。例えば、輸入関連や拡販支援などの部署があるため、ときには一緒にお客様訪問を行うこともあり、専門部署があることでとても助けられています。 ＜アピールポイント＞ ワークライフバランスを重視 年間休日123日！全額会社負担の社員寮も！！ 完全週休2日制（土日祝休み）で年間休日は123日！ これだけでも、しっかりリフレッシュできることは理解できると思いますが、「20時にパソコン強制シャットダウン」という独自の制度もあるため、「休みは多いけど、結局残業も多い…」なんてことにはなりません。また、終了時間が決まっているからこそ、効率良く仕事を進めるスキルも身に付きますよ。 生活費や帰省費が格段お得になる福利厚生も 全国各地に拠点のある当社では、社員寮（レンタル家具付き）の寮費を30歳まで「全額会社負担」。転職して間もない20代の生活費が格段お得になります。また、帰省時の交通費を全額会社負担してくれる「帰省旅費制度」も！ 1年で2回使うことができるため、お正月やお盆の帰省に役立ててくださいね。 教育制度・研修が充実 じっくり育成のスタイルで焦らず成長できます！ ニッチな業界ゆえに、中途入社の皆さんも、未経験から“じっくり3年間”の育成期間を設けています。「いきなり外回りに営業」ではなく、まずは内勤営業として先輩のサポートをしながら、商品知識や事務処理などを覚えていきます。同時に上司や先輩などの同行、展示会の参加など実務を通じて営業スキルや業界の知識も身に付けていきましょう。 半年から1年程度で、担当を持つことを目指します。最初は消耗品などの細かな商材からスタートし、ゆくゆくは「数億円規模のプロジェクトを受注した！」というようなスケールの大きな仕事も経験できますよ。 また、新製品のメーカー研修やエリアごとの講習会・勉強会も積極的に開催し、一人ひとりの成長を継続的にフォローしています。 専門性・スキルが身につく 商社＆メーカーとしての豊富な知識とノウハウを 溶接機器業界でNo.1のシェアを誇る当社でなら、自動溶接ロボットや産業機械など、業界でも最先端かつ数多くのアイテムの知識を得ることができます。取扱商品数は、カタログで言えば1,000ページ以上に。長年お客様の課題を真摯に解決してきたからこその数です。 そして、当社ならではのメーカー機能もあるため、オーダーメイドでお客様の課題を解決するモノづくりのノウハウも習得できますよ。 こう聞くと、「覚えるのが大変そう」と思われがちですが、焦ることはありません。育成期間が3年間と長いこと、さらに専門知識を有するサポート部署が多いため、わからないことがあっても質問しやすく、プラスαの新たな知識も得やすい環境です。 お互いに協力しながら、みんなで成長していきましょう。 ＜企業情報＞ 設立 昭和23年5月（1948年） 代表者 代表取締役社長 釘貫 恭造 従業員数
